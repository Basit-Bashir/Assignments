Q4 Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some alternatives to GitHub.

Answer - GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development projects using Git, a distributed version control system. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes to code, manage versions, and work together more efficiently, even across different locations.

Key Features of GitHub:
- **Version Control**: GitHub uses Git to track and manage changes in code, enabling developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
- **Collaboration**: Developers can work together on repositories (projects), make changes, review each other's code, and merge updates seamlessly.
- **Pull Requests**: This feature allows contributors to propose changes to a project, which can be reviewed and discussed before being merged into the main codebase.
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub includes tools for tracking bugs, feature requests, and other project management tasks.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub integrates with CI/CD tools, allowing automatic testing and deployment of code changes.

Alternatives to GitHub:
1. **GitLab**: Similar to GitHub, GitLab offers Git-based version control and collaboration features, with additional built-in CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Bitbucket**: Provides Git and Mercurial support with integration into Atlassian's suite of products like Jira for project management.
3. **SourceForge**: An older platform for hosting open-source software projects, offering version control and collaboration tools.
4. **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's platform that provides Git repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and extensive integration with other Azure services.

These alternatives provide similar functionalities for version control and collaboration, with varying levels of integration and additional features tailored to different development needs.
