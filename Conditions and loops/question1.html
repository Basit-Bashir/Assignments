Conditional statements are used in programming to make decisions based on
certain conditions. They allow a program to execute different blocks of code
depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The most
common types of conditional statements are "if," "else if," and "else." 1. if
statement: The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified
condition is true. eg: let x = 10; if (x > 5) { console.log("x is greater than
5"); } if-else, eg:let x = 3; if (x > 5) { console.log("x is greater than 5"); }
else { console.log("x is not greater than 5"); } Nested-if, eg: let x = 10; let
y = 5; if (x > 5) { if (y > 2) { console.log("Both x and y are greater than
their respective thresholds"); } else { console.log("x is greater than 5, but y
is not greater than 2"); } } else { console.log("x is not greater than 5"); }
